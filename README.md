# Hi, I'm a .NET Developer 👨‍💻

I'm a developer with over 5 years of commercial experience, involved in all product development cycles. I've worked on both large and small projects, where I:

- Communicated with analysts 📊
- Gathered business requirements 📝
- Covered the code with integration and unit tests 🔧

I'm passionate about products in the **Microsoft** ecosystem: new versions of **.NET**, as well as cloud solutions like **Azure** ☁️. Although I position myself as a **backend developer**, I also have commercial experience as a **full-stack developer**.

## 🛠️ Skills and Technologies
- **.NET (C#)** for backend development
- **Azure** for cloud solutions
- **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases
- **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing**
- **Git** and **CI/CD**

## 🏆 In my free time
I enjoy participating in **hackathons** with my friends, solving non-standard problems, and developing innovative solutions.
